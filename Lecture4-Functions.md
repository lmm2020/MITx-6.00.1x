# Decomposition and Abstraction
    abstraction: the idea that you can use a block of code and not need to know what's inside it. (ex: once a function is built, you dont need to know *how* it works, but can trust it to do what it's built for.)
    decomposition: breaking up a larger problem into smaller pieces. These pieces are meant to be reuseable.
