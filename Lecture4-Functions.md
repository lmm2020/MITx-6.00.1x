# Decomposition and Abstraction
    abstraction: the idea that you can use a block of code and not need to know what's inside it. (ex: once a function is built, you dont need to know *how* it works, but can trust it to do what it's built for.)
    decomposition: breaking up a larger problem into smaller pieces. These pieces are meant to be reuseable. 

# Functions and Scope
    Functions: blocks of code you can reuse over and over through your code. They are like compartments in your software that store code for later use. 
    Name: functions have a name 
    Parameters: arguments that a function can take, it can have zero OR you can set as many parameters as you need, and they can be any data type, even functions! (this is called Higher Order programming)
    Docstring: every function should have a docstring; documentation that tells you what it does. 
    Body: sequence of commands that we want to have happen when we use the funciton.
