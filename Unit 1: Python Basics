Algorithm: conceptual idea 
Program: concrete instantiation of an algoritm

A computational mode of thinking means that everything can ve viewed as a math problem involving formulas and numbers.

Computers can: perform calculations & remember results

Declarative knowledge refers to statements of fact. 
Imperative knowlefe refers to "how to" methods.

Fixed program computer: calculator, Turing's bombe
Stored program computer: sequence

Syntax: determines if a string is legal
Syntactic errors: example: "hi"5
Static semantic: determines whether a string has meaning
Static semantic errors: example: "The sky is heavy" passes on syntax, but is invalid by static semantics - no one can weigh the sky, so this doesn't mean anything.
Semantics: assigns a meaning to a legal sentence.  // "The sky is blue" both pass on syntax and static semantics (as above) and also on semantics - this is a meaningful sentence.

Scalar objects: example: int, floats, bool, NoneType (special, value=None)

Casting: changing a variable's type. 

+= increments and reassigns to variable 

Priority of Order Boolean Operations
1. Parenthesis
2. not
3. and
4. or
