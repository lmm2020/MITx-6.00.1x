Strings: enclosed in quotations 
concatenate: use + to put together strings
  you can also use arithmetic to strings ex. 3*'eric' would output ericericeric
 
len() will return the number of characters in a string 

slice: 
  [start point: end point (not incl)] 
  [:end point] returns everything from beg up to end point (not incl end point) 
  [:] returns copy of the string

input() 
  this will evaluate whatever is input and return a string. 
  if you want it to return and int you must cast it as int.

Control Flow: while loop

  while [condition]:
    [actions to perform]

    [condition] evaluates to a Boolean
    if [condition] is True, do all the steps inside the while code block
    check [condition] again
    repeat until [condition] is False

In a while loop:
  unknown number of iterations
  can end it early with a break 
  can use a counter but must initialize before loop and increment it inside the loop
  may not be able to rewrite a while loop using a or loop

Control Flow: for loop
for n in range(5):
  print(n)

In a for loop:
  we know the number of times its going to run through an iteration
  can end early with a break
  uses a counter inside the for loop
  can always rewrite a for loop using a while loop 

break statement: special key word that stops the execution of that loop/code
  immediately exits whatever loop it is in
  skips remaining expressions in code block
  exits only innermost loop

Note: What does +=, -=, *=, /= stand for?
a += b is equivalent to a = a + b

a -= b is equivalent to a = a - b

a *= b is equivalent to a = a * b

a /= b is equivalent to a = a / b

range(start, stop, step)

guess and check method: this is an algorthim caled exhaustive enumeration
  you guess a value
  check if solution is correct
  keep guessing until solution found, or guessed through all values


loop  characteristics
  need a loop variable
  **initialized outside loop** important to do this!!
  changes within loop 
  test for termination depends on variable

useful to think about a decrementing function
  when loop is entered, value is non-negative
  when value is <= 0, loop terminates and,
  value is decreased every time through loop
